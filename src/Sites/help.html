<p>The query interface is powered by <a href="http://www.ims.uni-stuttgart.de/projekte/CorpusWorkbench/"> 
the IMS Corpus Workbench</a>, but it has been extended to simplify
processing of some frequent cases.  
<p>
In its simplest mode, the web interface allows you to enter a search
term (a lemma) and search for its uses. You can also search for a list
of words (a disjunctive condition) by separating them with | signs,
e.g. <i>indignation|resentment</i> searching for indignation OR
resentment.  You can search for a substring, when the search term
contains .*, e.g. <i>indigna.*</i> finds <i>indignant</i> and
<i>indignation</i> (take care, when using the abbreviation and word
list options with more frequent words, the output may include many
thousands of lines).

<p> If you enter a sequence of words (separated with spaces), you will
search for an exact phrase (without lemmatisation). In order to search
for lemmas you need to add % to the end of each term.  For instance,
the query <i>set% in</i> will find <i>set in, sets in, setting in, Set
in</i> etc, while <i>set in</i> will find only <i>set in</i> (also
case-sensitive, even <i>Set in</i> does not fit the pattern).
At the same time, there is no sense in searching for <i>sets% in</i>, because there
is no lexical item <i>sets</i>.  

Because of corpus tokenisation, all punctuation marks have to be
separated from words with a space, e.g.
<i>finally , &nbsp;&nbsp;</i> to search for <i>finally</i> followed by a comma.  Remember
that according to
<a href="http://www.ims.uni-stuttgart.de/projekte/CorpusWorkbench/CQPUserManual/HTML/node13.html#SECTION00425000000000000000">
the CQP syntax</a> the dot (.) is a metacharacter corresponding to any
letter in the target string. You have to escape it with a backslash in
queries, if you want to search for its occurrences in
texts: <i>finally \. &nbsp;&nbsp;</i> to find <i>finally</i> at the
sentence end.

<p>
To specify a gap between words, you can use two dots: ...  For example, <i>make% .. &nbsp;&nbsp; up</i> will also find examples of <i>made it up</i>.  To find more examples like <i>made it up</i> one can use the pos tag, e.g. <i>make% .. &nbsp;&nbsp; /N.*|PP up</i>

<h2>Language-specific lemmatisation issues</h2>

Usually, lemmatisation and POS tagging is reliable, but in some cases it might be 

In Russian the search for
all forms of the expression <i>ложная тревога</i> should use the query
term
<i>ложный% тревога%</i> (a sequence of two lemmas).  Remember that this is
a short-hand for the full CQP query:<br>
[lemma="ложный"] [lemma="тревога"]

<p>Lemmatisation in Russian also assumes the mapping between closely
related aspectual pairs.  The corpus has no lemma like
<i>повернуть</i>, because its lemma is <i>поворачивать</i>.  Another
by-product of lemmatisation is that all lemmas in English and Russian
corpora are in the lower case (you will search for <i>moscow</i> and
<i>москва</i>).  

<p><b>Warning</b> In the German corpus, capital letters in lemmas are
important, because they can help in disambiguation: <i>Denken</i>
vs. <i>denken</i>.  Therefore lemmatisation in German does little case folding.
You can also use the full CQP syntax option to deal with
case-independent search: <br>[lemma="denken"%c] 

<p>Another feature of German lemmatisation (caused by peculiarities in the TreeTagger)
is that forms combining prepositions with articles are not decomposed:
<i>zum</i> is a lemma, while all forms of the definite article have
the lemma <i>d</i>, for instance, if you are looking for examples of
expression <i>Tod an den Hals w&uuml;nschen</i>, the lemma-based query
should be <i>Tod an d Hals w&uuml;nschen</i>.  You can also search for <i>"Tod an den Hals" w&uuml;nschen</i> (i.e. to treat the first three search terms as exact word forms)

<p>
These possibilities are provided on top of the
Corpus Query Processor, refer to <a href="http://www.ims.uni-stuttgart.de/projekte/CorpusWorkbench/CQPUserManual/HTML/">
the CQP Manual</a> for the full description of the query language, for
instance, if you want to specify conditions on word order or restrict
morphological properties of words in your query.  The values of
morphological properties for English and Russian words can be selected
by clicking on respective links and choosing values from the popup
windows.  Morphological codes will be added to the query string, but
ensure that your query conforms to <a href="http://www.ims.uni-stuttgart.de/projekte/CorpusWorkbench/CQPUserManual/HTML/">
the CQP syntax</a>. The interface simply adds strings like
<pre>
[pos="NNS"]
[pos="A.*,род.*"]
</pre>
to the query string, so, if you need to combine the POS and lemma conditions manually:
<pre>
[lemma="promt" & pos="JJ"]
[lemma="стакан" & pos=".*род.*"]
</pre>
<p><b>Warning</b> Because of limitations of the Corpus WorkBench, if
your query starts with a frequent word (such as a particle or a
preposition), its processing will take A LOT OF time and frequently
you'll get no result at all (because the time-out of your browser will expire).  You can remove the first word a complex query, if it is frequent while the context can be uniquely identified without it.  For instance, always use <i>Tod
an "den" Hals w&uuml;nschen</i>, but not
<i><b>den</b> Tod an "den" Hals w&uuml;nschen</i>, because the
Corpus WorkBench will not return any result for the latter.
<p>
Morphological features in the Russian fiction corpus have been
manually corrected, so morphological codes in it are reliable. The Russian  newscorpora and the Internet corpus has been processed automatically by 
<a href="http://corpora.narod.ru/mystem/">mystem</a>, so it contains many
ambiguities; for instance, книги is always analysed as sing,gen;
adverbs derived from adjectives (трудно) are always analysed as
adjectival forms (трудный).  Thus, it is not possible to rely on
morphological codes in other Russian corpora.
<!--
The BNC corpus (used as a
reference for Reuters texts) includes morphological tags from the BNC
World Edition from 2000, but it has been lemmatised using <a href="/tools/tools.html">custom tools</a>.

<p>
<a name="transliterate"></a>If you want to query the Russian corpus without a Cyrillic
keyboard, you can use transliteration according to the following table:
<pre>
'а' => 'a',
'б' => 'b',
'в' => 'v',
'г' => 'g',
'д' => 'd',
'е' => 'e',
'ж' => 'zh',
'з' => 'z',
'и' => 'i',
'й' => 'j',
'к' => 'k',
'л' => 'l',
'м' => 'm',
'н' => 'n',
'о' => 'o',
'п' => 'p',
'р' => 'r',
'с' => 's',
'т' => 't',
'у' => 'u',
'ф' => 'f',
'х' => 'x',
'ц' => 'c',
'ч' => 'ch',
'ш' => 'sh',
'щ' => 'w',
'ъ' => 'qh',
'ы' => 'y',
'ь' => 'q',
'э' => 'eh',
'ю' => 'ju',
'я' => 'ja',
</pre>
<p>
(the same transliteration scheme as in <a href="http://www.sfb441.uni-tuebingen.de/b1/en/korpora.html">the T&uuml;bingen interface to the Uppsala corpus</a>)

<p>
You can sort the output of your query according to its left or right context.  
Note that the match itself and the punctuation marks are treated as parts of 
the context, so a query using <i>go</i> will be sorted according to the right 
context as follows (first <i>go</i>, then <i>going</i>, then <i>went</i>):
<table><tbody>
<TR>
<TD ALIGN=RIGHT nowrap>. Help provided by ACET volunteers eventually </TD><TD nowrap> <b>go </b> </TD><TD nowrap>the flat ship-shape again and life became easier . Illnesses </TD></TR><TR>

<p>
The output ends with a set of basic translation equivalents for words in the query.
The facility is based on the English-Russian dictionary developed by <a href="http://www.multitran.ru">Multitran</a>,
thanks to the Multitran development team, especially to Andrei Pominov.  Every word in the list of
translation equivalents links to a new query.
<p>
The option <b>Collocation statistics</b> allows you to calculate the most significant collocates (using log-likelihood, mutual information or T score) for the left or right neighbour of your query; for the definitions see <a href="http://nlp.stanford.edu/fsnlp/promo/colloc.pdf">Chapter 5 "Collocations"</a> from Christopher Manning, Hinrich Sch&uuml;tze, <a href="http://nlp.stanford.edu/fsnlp/">Foundations of Statistical Natural Language Processing</a>. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press. 1999.
<p>
The option <b>Word similarity search</b> allows you to find semantic classes for some lines in the output of your query.  This is based on <a href="http://www.fask.uni-mainz.de/user/rapp/">Reinhard Rapp's procedure</a> using
<a href="http://www.cs.utk.edu/~berry/projects.html">Singular Value Decomposition</a> (SVD).
